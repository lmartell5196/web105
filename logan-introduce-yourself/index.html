          Tech:
          I've been into technology since I was a kid. I grew up watching my brothers play tons of video games, and my dad often worked on his computer. It was a sense of wonder; I didn't fully understand how you could plug a box into the wall and it make a full display of colors appear perfectly on a screen. Since then, I've spent a lot of my time exploring technology in my own way. Building PCs and keyboards, exploring software, taking classes, trying game development, and making friends with the same interests as me.

          Music:
          My family has always been very into music. My three older brothers all play guitar, and my dad plays clarinet. I grew up mostly trying to learn clarinet, since my dad was the only one who was willing to teach me, and so wind instruments were what I was most accustomed to moving into middle school, where I picked up the trumpet. I was pretty good, and improved faster than the rest of the class, easily passing the Jazz Band audition. Later in middle school, I learned how to play the ukulele and still do in my free time.

          Language: This past December, I got really bored and decided I should try to learn a really difficult language. According to Google, the most difficult languages for English speakers are Chinese and Japanese, so I settled on Japanese. I started using Duolingo to learn, and had two of three main Japanese character sets memorized by about week two. I'm currently on Unit 6 and hope to continue learning.

        My Goals with Hobbies:
      </p>
      <p>
        For the longest time, my dream has been to become a music producer, either making my own music or producing for others. My hobbies all align with this goal; Combining technology and music makes for a decent shot at digital music production, and if I continue to learn Japanese (or other languages) I could reach out to a larger audience. In the meantime though, I plan to start making YouTube videos around most of my hobbies, including gaming, music, and other tech related things. I also have a small PC and keyboard building service; email me for more information.
