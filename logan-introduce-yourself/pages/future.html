        <p>
          Overall, I hope aim to have the best future I can achieve. I want to stay in college and try to not only get a degree but learn as much as I can in every subject I'm interested in, as I find the most happiness in learning new skills. Career-wise, I want to get a job possibly as a systems administrator while spending time at home learning more music production skills. Some of my other goals include: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Improve my physical self (work out)</li>
          <li>Build relationships with others who are into music production</li>
          <li>Develop some small games</li>
          <li>Financial stability (financially free)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My long term goal is happiness and being able to live a long life doing what I want. By building experience in tech and music related fields, I can get the dream job I'm after and save towards a better life. Honestly its all easier said than done, so hopefully I can lock in and actually work for what I want.

        "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life."
